\begin{answer}
	The third choice fails completely since its corresponding matrix is not PSD; therefore, it is an invalid kernel function.
	It classifies all examples to the same class.
The dot product kernel performs badly as the data is not linearly separable.
Recall that kernels map $x$ to another feature space $\phi(x)$ but when we use dot-product kernel, we simply have $\phi(x)=x$; therefore, dot-product performs well when data is linearly separable.
