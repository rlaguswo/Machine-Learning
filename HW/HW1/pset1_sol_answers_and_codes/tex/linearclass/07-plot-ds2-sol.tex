	GDA seems to perform worse than logistic regression on Dataset 1
	(GDA Accuracy: 0.81 and LR Accuracy: 0.83).
	This is probably because the $x^{(i)}$'s are not Gaussian. We
	saw in the notes that logistic regression is more robust than GDA
	when the underlying dataset is not drawn from a multivariate Gaussian.
